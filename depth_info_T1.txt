Painter:Wei:
CTDs, DIC and nutrient samples up to 2100 m. ADCP 60x16m depth bins (so up to 960 m?).

Yuan:
Surface (satelite altimetry, HF radar and ADCP measurments)

Fewings:
Shallow coastal water 12m depth. Measurements cover entire depth range (0-12m).

Woodson:
Three mooring locations at 19, 20, and 21m depth plus ADCP. Not Entirely sure of depth of ADCP measurements, but their analysis covers the top 20 or 21 metres.

Waite:
Surface drifters with additional ADCP, O2, Chlorophyll, nitrate, salinity, 'large particles', and temperature profiles along transects up to 400m depth.

Wei:
From surface to depth (potentially up to 1200m). Couldn't find information on the line of moored stations (the authors describe it simply as "The PN section is a well-known array of hydrographic observation that transects the Kuroshio" without defining PN). Other papers reference a PN-line of observations in the East China Sea but these they're in different positions. I'm only assuming their moored stations sample at depth because they fit a 2D model (transect with depth).
